# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The program that was to be created for module 7 was a grocery tracking code. This program was needed to daily analize records for the items in the store. 
# What did you do particularly well?
Through having a previous understanding of combining languages in another module. Building the essential foundation for the code this time was less hectic and more understandable when bringing together python and C++.
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
In reference to this code as times goes on coming back with more knowledge on how different operating systems work, beginning this code again and comparing how they coencide with each other and see what has improved. 
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The code in itself was no easy feature but the most challenging was breaking down each needed component and implenenting it whereas needing each item to be analized through the day and how often eeach day.
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The main skill I hope translates from here onward is of course integrating the different languages and seeing how that goes on to improve different software and programs. 
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
When coming to understand the code, it is important to make sure comments are well read not just for the one creating it but those who the program is given to, whether that be a company or instructor.
